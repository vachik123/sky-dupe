# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a React application that replicates the user interface shown in the provided image. The UI consists of a central, translucent window with a header and a list of suggested commands, set against a desktop-like background.

## Styling and Design

*   **Visual Style:** The application will replicate the "glassmorphism" effect seen in the image, characterized by a blurred, translucent background, subtle borders, and soft shadows. The overall aesthetic will be clean, modern, and inspired by macOS design elements.
*   **Background:** The application will feature a background image that mimics a desktop wallpaper to provide context for the central UI element.
*   **Typography:** Fonts will be chosen to match the clean and modern aesthetic of the image.
*   **Iconography:** The UI will incorporate icons for buttons to enhance usability and visual appeal.
*   **Color Palette:** The color scheme will be light and airy, with an emphasis on white and light grays for the UI elements and a background that complements the overall design.

## Component Breakdown

*   **App:** The main component that serves as the root of the application.
*   **BackgroundImage:** A component responsible for displaying the desktop-like background image.
*   **Main Content Window:** A central window with the glassmorphism effect.
    *   **Header:** Contains the "SKY" logo and action buttons ("Attach," "Settings," "New Chat").
    *   **Suggestions:** A list of tappable suggested commands.

## Plan

1.  **Set up the basic HTML structure and React components.**
2.  **Style the application with CSS to achieve the glassmorphism effect.**
3.  **Incorporate icons for the buttons.**
4.  **Add the suggested commands.**
5.  **Refine the styling to match the provided image.**
